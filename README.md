# AI_Chatbot using Python

This project implements a simple AI chatbot using Python. The chatbot is trained on various patterns and questions that users might ask. The training data is provided in the intents.json file.

# Customization
To expand the chatbot's capabilities, you can add more intents, patterns, and responses in the intents.json file. This will enhance the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to a wider range of user queries.
